<h2 id="col">* MY VIEWS *</h2>
<div class="vir">HOW CAN A FAN AND ADMIRER OF VIRAT LIKE ME SAY ANY LESS ABOUT HIM?
<center><p>VIRAT IS JUST SIMPLY AMAZING. HE HAS A VISION FOR EVERYTHING. HE TAKES WHAT HE WANTS, NO MATTER WHAT!
I REMEMBER AN INCIDENCE OF HIM BACK FROM 2016.
IN 2016 IPL, VIRAT WAS INJURED IN ONE OF THE MATCHES BEFORE THE PLAYOFFS. HE HAD GOT TEN STITCHES ON HIS HAND. THAT WAS THE TIME WHEN RCB WERE LEFT WITH 2 MATCHES TO GO WITH AND THEY HAD MANY CHANCES TO GET QUALIFIED TO THE PLAYOFFS. EVEN THO HE HAD STICHES, VIRAT HIT CENTUARY IN 2ND LAST MATCH AND HALF CENTURY IN THE LAST MATCH. <br>AT LAST, NO MATTER WHAT, HE BROUGHT HIS TEAM UP TO THE 2ND POSITION. <BR>IT IS SAID RIGHT THAT, A WOUNDED TIGER IS MORE POWERFUL.
LIKE REST OF THE FANS AND ADMIRERS, I WISH THAT VIRAT KEEPS PLAYING AND WINNING FOR INDIA UNTIL WE LIFT YET ANOTHER WORLD CUP! CHEERS!</p></center></div> </center>
